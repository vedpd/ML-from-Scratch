# ML-from-Scratch
This repository has been made to implement all the machine learning algorithms using python and without using any existing libraries

1. The 1st algorithm that has been implemented is a basic [Linear Regression](https://github.com/vedpd/ML-from-Scratch/blob/main/LinearRegression_implementation.ipynb) algorithm, which also has a toy dataset created to test the model.
